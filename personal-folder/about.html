      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        MotivaHub is designed to help students stay positive, organized,
        and emotionally supported during their academic journey. Whether you're
        balancing school, work, or personal challenges, small moments of inspiration 
        can make a big difference. This site aims to provide those uplifting moments
        through motivational quotes, goal tracking, and personalized encouragement.

      <h2>Why Motivation Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Students face constant pressure—deadlines, exams, projects, social expectations,
        and the challenges of balancing personal well-being. Research shows that motivation, 
        self-reflection, and positive reinforcement can significantly improve academic 
        performance and emotional resilience.
